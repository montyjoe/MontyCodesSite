        <p>Hello! My name is Jordan Montgomery. I’m a 24 year-old full-stack web developer from Torrance, CA, looking for opportunities in the Los Angeles area. I have been coding for almost 2 years now and I graduated last year from Coding Dojo Burbank with the highest certification in Web Fundamentals, Python, iOS, as well as studying the MEAN stack. I have also since finished a course in React, and recently started learning PHP.<br><br>I’m a budding cinephile; I made a point the last two years to watch every oscar nominated movie in theaters (moviepass has saved me SO much money). Some highlites from the last two years include <i>Lion</i>, <i>La La Land</i>, <i>Manchester by the Sea</i>, and <i>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</i>. I'm a major Star Wars nerd; I am among those who believe that episode 8 was a travesty and that the prequels really weren’t THAT bad. I love gaming; ever since my dad bought me my first console 16 years ago, the controller and I have been inseparable. Lately all my gaming time has been devoted to Fortnite, but I enjoy Minecraft and various racing games as well. I discovered a passion for editing and making videos when I realized I was spending so much time on YouTube. In an ideal world, I would have started posting videos 7 or 8 years ago and have 14 million subscribers by now, but in reality I only have 14.. but that doesn’t make it any less fun. When it’s cold out and I’m not doing any of those things, you might find me up in the mountains snowboarding.<br><br>If there’s anything I can help you with, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I would love to talk and hopefully work with you in the future!</p>

            This website was created for my neighbor and I to post articles and videos relating to various topics in the video game industry. It uses HTML and CSS, and I am currently working on making the site scalable so it will easily grow as our content increases.

            This Web application was one of the final projects I worked on while taking a course on React. The application accesses the Spotify api to connect with your personal account. Using the search function, you can find music by name, artist, or album and add it to a custom named playlist. Once your playlist is complete, clicking "save to Spotify" adds the playlist to your Spotify account instantly.

            Two Thumbs Up was a group project during our time at the Coding Dojo. We created an application which would allow users to rate movies and TV shows by accesesing TMDB (the movie database) api, as well as add them to a watchlist. The user would be able to follow other users and see the reviews of movies they watched. SQLlite was used with Django to store all of our information.  I helped with the overall design of the website and was tasked with implementing the api for TMDB
